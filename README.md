The code used to train and test using AutoML is in TrainFlowData.py and TestFlowData.py, respectively. 

The data used in this project has been uploaded to this \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15XdOBAxXn1zjdk9G8X-G398Khdk_AaIz?usp=sharing}{google drive folder}. There are 12 different datasets in the folder, four that were used for training, four for testing, and another four that are the combination of both training and testing data.
